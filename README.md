Some Project Euler solutions in Python 3
Solutions for few challenges on Project Euler in Python 3.
The older ones' code which were in C/C++/Javascript are lost and I only have the answers, which are simple numbers for the calculations.
Note that Project Euler is mostly concerned with mathematics above coding skills.
